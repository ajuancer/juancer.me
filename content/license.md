This web is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/ajuancer/ajuancer.github.io) so you can check all the code. Currently it uses no JS at all and all the templates and style is wrapped in the [`simple`](https://github.com/ajuancer/ajuancer.github.io/tree/main/themes/simple) theme instead of the web root —making it much more easier to use—.
