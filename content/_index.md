# ðŸ‘‹ Â¡Hola!
I am Juan CerdeÃ±o (@juancer and derivates on the internet) and this is my personal website. I'm currently enrolled in university. On my free time I enjoy diving into software projects and exploring the vast world of technology on the internet. Most of my projects are hosted on [Github/@ajuancer](https://github.com/ajuancer).

I also like sports and hiking.

# Contact
The best way to get in touch with me is by email. Hereâ€™s how you can reach me for different things:

* General inquiries: You can email me at hi@juancer.me for any general questions or just to say hi.
* Academic and uni stuff: For inquiries regarding academics or university matters, please use my official email provided by the organization.
* Website stuff: For anything related to my websiteâ€™s infrastructure, services, or security, drop a line to webmaster@juancer.me.
* I may provide you with another email address thatâ€™s better suited for our conversation, so please use that one. Please keep these email addresses private and refrain from sharing them with others.

I look forward to hearing from you!
