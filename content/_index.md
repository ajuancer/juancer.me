# ðŸ‘‹ Hey!
I am Juan CerdeÃ±o, a Spanish teenager currently studying at uni. On [my Github](https://github.com/ajuancer) you can find [my projects](https://github.com/ajuancer?tab=repositories). A legend says that I have a [blog section](/posts), but be aware that I rarely use it.

You can reach me on [hi@juancer.me](mailto:hi@juancer.me).
