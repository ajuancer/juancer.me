# ðŸ‘‹ Â¡Hola!

I am Juan CerdeÃ±o (juancer and derivates on the internet) and this is my personal website.
I am currently enrolled in university (in fact, in two).
I work at the [CÃ¡tedra MBA Institute of the University of Oviedo](https://catedrambainstitute.uniovi.es) dedicated to medical and biomedical research.

On my free time I mostly code. Most of my projects live at [github:ajuancer](https://github.com/ajuancer).

I also like sports and hiking.

# Contact

The best way to get in touch with me is by email. Hereâ€™s how you can reach me for different things:

- You can email me at hi@juancer.me for general stuff or just to say hi.
- For inquiries regarding academics or university matters, please use my official email provided by the organization.
- For anything related to my websiteâ€™s infrastructure, services, or security, drop a line to webmaster@juancer.me.
- I may provide you with another email address thatâ€™s better suited for our conversation, so please use that one. Please keep these email addresses private and refrain from sharing them with others.

I look forward to hearing from you!
